# Program Synthesis With a Stack-Based Concatenative Language
- Built a Tree-LSTM model for program synthesis 

- Introduced a program synthesis model to predict terms that transform the given inputs to the given outputs.

- Designed and implemented a DSL using PyTorch. Incorporated a Tree-LSTM network with a beam search algorithm.
